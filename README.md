# FakeStoreAPI

[FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com) is a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need Pseudo-real data for
your e-commerce or shopping website without running any server-side code.
It's awesome for teaching purposes, sample codes, tests and etc.

You can visit in detail docs in [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com) for more information.

## Why?

When I wanted to design a shopping website prototype and needed fake data, I had to
use lorem ipsum data or create a JSON file from the base. I didn't find any online free web service
to return semi-real shop data instead of lorem ipsum data.
so I decided to create this simple web service with NodeJs(express) and MongoDB as a database.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
